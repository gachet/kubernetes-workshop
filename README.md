# Bitnami Kubernetes Workshop

Here you can find the hands-on exercises, some useful guides and some information which complements the session.

## Hands-on

During the session we will put in practice all the knowledge in practical exercises.

For these, you may need some code base or additional information. You can find it in the [hands-on](./hands-on) folder.

## Cheatsheet

To make things easier, we have created a document with the most used commands, and the templates of the documents we're going to use during the workshop. You can find it in the [cheatsheet](./cheatsheet) folder.
